  abstract = {The United Kingdom holds the largest stockpile of separated civil plutonium in the world, projected to reach 140t, at the end of this decade, when reprocessing operations are complete. UK Government policy is that this material should be reused as MOX fuel in Light Water Reactors. This policy is re-examined in the light of recent experience of the US plutonium disposition programme, in which the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility is now considered to be potentially unaffordable. Problematic aspects of US programme, relevant to the UK scenario, are reviewed, to understand the possible impact on UK policy. Based on the US experience and inherent uncertainty regarding the capital and operational costs of MOX fuel fabrication and plutonium immobilisation facilities, and the associated technical risks, it is concluded that the UK policy should explicitly adopt a dual track strategy to plutonium management, with commitment that: any remaining plutonium which is not converted into MOX fuel, or otherwise reused, will be immobilised and treated as waste for disposal. This will also ensure that the UK is positioned and prepared to take forward an immobilisation and disposal programme for the plutonium stockpile, should reuse as MOX fuel not prove an economic or viable option.},

The inspection of such containers poses a significant challenge due to the large quantities involved; therefore, automating the inspection process is of considerable interest. This paper reports upon a proof-of-concept project concerning the automated NDT of a set of test containers containing artificially generated AISCCs. An Eddy current array probe with a conformable padded surface from Eddyfi was used as the NDT sensor and end effector on a KUKA KR5 arc HW robot. A kinematically valid cylindrical raster scan path was designed using the KUKA|PRC path planning software. Custom software was then written to interface measurement acquisition from the Eddyfi hardware with the motion control of the robot. Preliminary results and analysis are presented from scanning two canisters.},

Owing to the expansion of the field of application of ERW pipe to include high-toughness and high-strength line pipes and higher grade oil country tubular goods, it became necessary to increase the stringency of the quality control system of the ERW mill. To meet this need, new in-line ultrasonic testing systems have been developed for ERW mills in Wakayama Steel Works of Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. As a result, the new systems can detect defects in the mid-call portion which can not be found by conventional methods, and the new systems can reliably detect defects so that the accuracy rate of defect inspection has been doubled and the rejection rate has been significantly reduced.},

  abstract = {Endless strip generation is the key to productivity and quality in several types of steel coil production lines. Coil-to-coil joining by means of welding machines provides such a strip. Since the joint is the weakest area of the strip, its quality must be assessed in order for the production line to accept it. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the quality of the weld in the welding-cycle time. Based on our knowledge acquired in the previous development of quality assessment prototypes for steel strips, we present in this paper an improved inspection system to detect defective resistance seam welds based on anomaly detection techniques. This system does not rely on the weld classifications done in production lines based on welding control programs. Therefore, it is immune to the influence of both incorrectly configured welding control programs and chemical composition variations from coil to coil of the same steel grade. Tuning the inspection system required a fully experimental design which would have taken several months in a conventional computer. For this reason, the high-performance computing facilities at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Center were used to cut down the tuning time.},

  abstract = {Nondestructive inspection (NDI) is an integral part of structural integrity analyses of dry storage casks that house spent nuclear fuel. One significant concern for the structural integrity is stress corrosion cracking in the heat-affected zone of welds in the stainless steel canister that confines the spent fuel. In situ NDI methodology for detection of stress corrosion cracking is investigated, where the inspection uses a delivery robot because of the presence of the harsh environment and geometric constrains inside the cask protecting the canister. Shear horizontal (SH) guided waves that are sensitive to cracks oriented either perpendicular or parallel to the wave vector are used to locate welds and to detect cracks. SH waves are excited and received by electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) using noncontact ultrasonic transduction and pulse-echo mode. A laboratory-scale canister mock-up is fabricated and inspected using the proposed methodology to evaluate the ability of EMATs to excite and receive SH waves and to locate welds. The EMAT's capability to detect notches from various distances is evaluated on a plate containing 25\%-through-thickness surface-breaking notches. Based on the results of the distances at which notch reflections are detectable, NDI coverage for spent nuclear fuel storage canisters is determined.},

Tests have been carried out on filament wound carbon fibre-reinforced plastic tubes with a variety of defects and on a honeycomb panel fabricated from pre-impregnated fibre. The results show that a test taking under ten seconds to set up and one second to carry out can detect general defects such as incorrect fibre volume fraction and winding angle in filament wound components, and incorrect lay-up in components constructed from pre-impregnated fibre. The sensitivity of the test is limited by the degree of scatter in the properties of good components. At present, the scatter is too high for small localized defects to be detected.},

Tests have been carried out on aluminium plates with flat-bottomed holes and on structures with CFRP skins having aluminium and Nomex honeycomb cores with deliberately introduced skin-core disbonds. The results indicate that on conducting structures, using eddy current excitation, the instrument has greater sensitivity to deep defects than either the mechanical impedance or coin-tap methods, 50 mm diameter defects 7 mm deep being detectable in an aluminium structure, whereas with the other techniques, the margin of detectability is at depths between 3 and 5 mm. The results indicate that the sensitivity of the method to near-surface defects is comparable to that of the coin-tap technique, and that like the coin-tap method its reliability is maintained on flexible structures whereas that of the mechanical impedance method is severely reduced. The eddy current excitation system used in the tests reported here cannot be used on weakly conducting materials such as CFRP-skinned Nomex honeycomb. If an alternative piezoelectric exciter were to be used, the advantages of a non-contacting system would be lost.},

This has enabled the sensitivity of the method to be defined, it being shown that a defect which produces a 1.5 dB difference in measured impedance compared with a good area of structure is at the margin of detectability. This means that a skin-core disbond 10 mm in diameter can be found under a honeycomb structure with 0.5 mm thick CFRP skins, but that with 1 mm thick skins a defect 20 mm in diameter is close to the margin of detectability. These values apply only to stiff structures: the reliability of the test is greatly reduced in flexible testpieces. It has also been shown that an impedance head can be used as an alternative to the vibrating-rod transducer employed in the commercially available instruments.},

  abstract = {Holography is the science and practice of making holograms. Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than of an image formed by a lens, and it is used to display a fully three-dimensional image of the holographed subject, which is seen without the aid of special glasses or other intermediate optics. The hologram itself is not an image and is usually unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light. It is an encoding of the light field as an interference pattern of seemingly random variations in the opacity, density, or surface profile of the photographic medium. When suitably lit, the interference pattern diffracts the light into a reproduction of the original light field and the objects that were in it appear to still be there, exhibiting visual depth cues such as parallax and perspective that change realistically with any change in the relative position of the observer.
In its pure form, holography requires the use of laser light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram. In a side-by-side comparison under optimal conditions, a holographic image is visually indistinguishable from the actual subject. A microscopic level of detail throughout the recorded volume of space can be reproduced. In common practice, however, major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination when viewing the hologram, and sometimes, to the extent possible, also when making it. Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the hazardous high-powered pulsed lasers otherwise needed to optically "freeze" living subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated to show objects or scenes that never existed.
Holography is distinct from lenticular and other earlier autostereoscopic 3D display technologies, which can produce superficially similar results but are based on conventional lens imaging. Stage illusions such as Pepper's Ghost and other unusual, baffling, or seemingly magical images are also often incorrectly called holograms.},

It is gaining more and more acceptance by automotive and aerospace industries in the field of nondestructive testing (NDT) of composite materials. A key optical component used in shearography is a shearing device in which the shearing amount, shearing direction and under the most cases the phase shift technique are determined and introduced. The paper displays different shearing devices. A theoretical analysis and an experimental comparison between them are demonstrated. The new measuring system of digital shearography with a capability for simultaneous measurement both in x and y directions and new concept for shearing amount, i.e. the critical shearing amount at which the measuring setup has a maximal sensitivity, are developed and introduced. The measuring sensitivity, the manner of load and illumination are discussed in details. The recent developments of digital shearography for NDT and its potentials, limitations and application are demonstrated by examples of NDT for different materials.},

  abstract = {The present work experimentally investigates the correlations between ultrasonic attenuation coefficient and void content with the porosity 0.03\%-4.96\% of the carbon fiber-reinforced composite (CFRC) samples. The ultrasonic echo immersion bottom reflection technique with 5MHz flat probe is adopted to determine the attenuation coefficient and the metallographic microscope is used to measure the porosity destructively. A linear and a parabolic curve are found to be suitable to fit the data with the porosity 0.03\%-0.5\% and 0.5\%-4.96\%, respectively. It is observed that ultrasonic predictions accord with the microscopic results. The present data have been compared with the known testing models and empirical formulas. The power law between the attenuation coefficient and the porosity, the critical porosity phenomenon, and the effects of void morphology on ultrasonic attenuation have been discussed. This work not only provides experimental evidence in making clear the ultrasonic attenuation mechanism of pores, but also further proves that the attenuation coefficient could be used to nondestructively characterize the void content in composites.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is to study the guided ultrasonic wave (GUW) behaviour in composite plates using 3D Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Two types of composite models are chosen: plates with and without damage. The damage is modelled as a circular-shaped delamination inside the plate, representing one kind of low-velocity impact damage. Parameters such as excitation frequency, monitoring directivity, plate thickness, delamination size and shape were used to investigate the influence of these parameters on the GUW propagation and scattering behaviour. The models were constructed and coded in Matlab platform, while the simulations were performed in ABAQUS Explicit. From the results, the received signals have shown a strong dependency on the parameters. Significant scattering from the models with delamination were also observed, which indicates the possibility of using GUW for rapid nondestructive monitoring of composite panels and structures.},

Initially, many composites were employed as fairings or reinforcements, but they are being increasingly used in primary and secondary load-bearing structures, where a mechanical failure has significantly greater safety implications. This increased scope has resulted in composite structures of significant thickness and complexity. Despite this, there has not been a corresponding increase in research pertinent to the detection and characterisation of defects in thick structures, apart from a brief period of interest by the NDE community in the early 1990s. This review critically assesses advances reported in the NDE of thick-section composites (structures of thickness above 15mm are considered for the purposes of this review), and identifies future research opportunities to overcome the limitations of existing technologies.},

  abstract = {A tier 1 automotive supplier has developed a novel and unique kinetic energy recovery storage system for both retro-fitting and OEM application for public transport systems where periodic stop start behaviour is paramount. A major component of the system is a composite flywheel spinning at up to 36,000rpm (600Hz). Material soundness is an essential requirement of the flywheel to ensure failure does not occur. The component is particularly thick for a composite being up to 30mm cross section in some places. The geometry, scale and material make-up pose some challenges for conventional NDT systems. Damage can arise in composite materials during material processing, fabrication of the component or in-service activities among which delamination, cracks and porosity are the most common defects. A number of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are effective in testing components for defects without damaging the component. NDT techniques like Ultrasonic Testing, X-Ray, Radiography, Thermography, Eddy current and Acoustic Emission are current techniques for various testing applications. Each of these techniques uses different principles to look into the material for defects. However, the geometry, physical and material properties of the component being tested are important factors in the applicability of a technique. This paper reviews these NDT techniques and compares them in terms of characteristics and applicability to composite parts.},

  abstract = {Using ultrasonic arrays to detect and characterise surface breaking cracks is important in the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) field. It can provide early warning of failure and useful information for component integrity assessment. Typically, cracks are approximated by machined slots and used to examine and assess defect detection and characterisation methods. In this paper, real surface breaking cracks are fabricated in 3-point bending specimens following ASTM standard E1820 and used to examine the performance of two array defect characterisation methods: image-based and scattering matrix sizing. In both cases, an array is used to record the full matrix capture (FMC). In image-based sizing, the total focusing method (TFM) is used to form an image from which the defect size is measured directly. This approach is shown to work well for cracks greater than two wavelengths in size. The FMC is also used to extract the defect scattering matrix which is then compared to a pre-computed smooth-crack scattering matrix database. The best match between experiment and this database is found by cross-correlation and used to characterise the defect. This approach is shown to work well for defects in the range of 0.78–1.84 wavelengths. Within these ranges of applicability, both methods show excellent agreement between the known crack length and that measured ultrasonically, with errors less than 19\% in all cases.},

It is now able to provide highly accurate three-dimensional (3D) inspections of fibre architectures, manufacturing defects and in-service damage accumulation non-destructively, allowing the user to examine cross-sections that would previously have required laborious and skilled mechanical sectioning with the potential for inducing damage or loss of material. Further, by repeated acquisition of 3D images, it has opened new opportunities for time-lapse studies. This feature article reviews the technical aspects relating to the X-ray CT imaging of composites such as obtaining sufficient contrast, examination of thin panels, sample size/resolution issues, quantification of damage and defects, and image-based modelling. The capability of X-ray CT to provide important information is considered across applications ranging from manufacturing processes, through tensile and compression loading to fatigue and impact damage. The complementary advantages of laboratory and synchrotron X-ray CT are examined with a view to identify new opportunities and challenges.},

  abstract = {The porosity of carbon fibre-reinforced polymers is a very important topic for the practical applications of this material since there is a direct correlation between porosity and mechanical properties, such as shear strength. Therefore the porosity values of carbon fibre-reinforced composites for practical use in aircraft and cars must be lower than a certain level, usually 2.5-5 \%. The most common nondestructive method for measuring the porosity is ultrasonic testing, since there is a mostly linear correlation between ultrasonic attenuation and porosity. However, the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient depends not only on the porosity, but also on the shape and distribution of the pores and the presence of other material inhomogeneities. This can lead to significant errors in the determination of the porosity. Acid digestion and materialography are also used for porosity measurement, but both methods are destructive. This paper deals with the application of X-ray computed tomography for the characterization of carbon fibre-reinforced composites, in particular for the quantitative determination of porosity with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In order to attain this, different segmentation methods were applied, systematic computed tomography investigations on a broad variety of composite samples with different measurement parameters were performed and the results are compared with results obtained by standard porosity measurement methods, such as ultrasonic testing and acid digestion. In addition, the possibility of characterizing the size, shape and position of all individual pores and other material inhomogeneities in three dimensions are demonstrated.},

These flaws/anomalies can be present in both vintage pipe (generally pre-1970) manufactured using a low frequency ERW process and more modern pipe that is manufactured using a high frequency ERW process. ERW seam anomalies are challenging to detect, discriminate, and size with current In-Line Inspection and In-Ditch NDE inspection technologies, which is driving the industry to better understand current inspection industry performance and to develop new technologies for ERW seam anomaly inspection.Ultrasonic (UT) imaging using inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX) is an emerging NDE technique that is being applied to improve discrimination and sizing of anomalies in pipelines. This paper will describe the IWEX development, the challenges related to seam weld integrity and assessment and SCC assessment, and results from studies to evaluate performance. Ultrasonic imaging is also compared to the current state-of-the-art techniques such as ultrasonic phased array (PA). A goal of the project is to produce images capable of discriminating cold welds, surface breaking hook cracks, non-surface breaking upturned fiber indications, poor trim, offset plate edges, and anomalies with fatigue cracking. The goal is to size all of the cracks in a SCC colony and produce a three-dimensional map of the area. In mapping these anomalies the sizing needs to be sufficiently accurate to qualify in-line inspection tools used for crack inspection.},

  abstract = {Background
Cancellation of planned surgery impacts substantially on patients and health systems. This study describes the incidence and reasons for cancellation of inpatient surgery in the UK NHS.
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational cohort study over 7 consecutive days in March 2017 in 245 NHS hospitals. Occurrences and reasons for previous surgical cancellations were recorded. Using multilevel logistic regression, we identified patient- and hospital-level factors associated with cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity.
Results
We analysed data from 14 936 patients undergoing planned surgery. A total of 1499 patients (10.0\%) reported previous cancellation for the same procedure; contemporaneous hospital census data indicated that 13.9\% patients attending inpatient operations were cancelled on the day of surgery. Non-clinical reasons, predominantly inadequate bed capacity, accounted for a large proportion of previous cancellations. Independent risk factors for cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity included requirement for postoperative critical care [odds ratio (OR)=2.92; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.12–4.02; P{$<$}0.001] and the presence of an emergency department in the treating hospital (OR=4.18; 95\% CI, 2.22–7.89; P{$<$}0.001). Patients undergoing cancer surgery (OR=0.32; 95\% CI, 0.22–0.46; P{$<$}0.001), obstetric procedures (OR=0.17; 95\% CI, 0.08–0.32; P{$<$}0.001), and expedited surgery (OR=0.39; 95\% CI, 0.27–0.56; P{$<$}0.001) were less likely to be cancelled.
Conclusions
A significant proportion of patients presenting for surgery have experienced a previous cancellation for the same procedure. Cancer surgery is relatively protected, but bed capacity, including postoperative critical care requirements, are significant risk factors for previous cancellations.},

  abstract = {Inspection for corrosion and pitting defects in the petrochemical industry is vital and forms a significant fraction of the operating expenditure. Low frequency guided wave inspection is frequently employed as it gives large area coverage from a single transducer position. However, detection becomes problematic at inaccessible regions such as pipe supports or beyond T-joints since the low frequency guided waves produce a significant reflection from the feature itself, hence limiting the defect detectability of the method. This suggests testing at higher frequencies which helps to minimise the reflection from the feature and also improves the sensitivity to smaller defects. There are a number of guided wave and related techniques implemented for corrosion inspection including the S0 mode (at ∼ 1 MHz-mm), SH0 and SH1 modes (at ∼ 3 MHz-mm), CHIME, M-skip and Higher Order Mode Cluster (A1 mode at ∼ 18 MHz-mm). This paper presents a systematic analysis of the defect detection performance of each method with sharp and gradual defects, as well as their sensitivity to attenuative coatings, liquid loading, surface roughness and ability to test beyond features such as T-joints. It is shown by finite element analysis backed up by experiments that the A1 mode provides the best overall performance when dealing with surface features such as T-joints and coatings because of its low surface motion. Additionally a combination of two or more methods is suggested for corrosion inspection at inaccessible locations: The A1 mode in reflection for severe, sharp, pitting type defects; long range guided waves in reflection for large-area thinning and the SH1 mode in transmission for shallow, gradual defects.},

  abstract = {Circumferential shear horizontal (SH) waves are used for the inspection and sizing of axial cracks in pipelines. Experiments on two sample pipes having notches with different depths and lengths were carried out utilizing magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) technology for generating circumferential shear horizontal guided waves. A simplified two-dimensional model for crack sizing in pipes was studied through wave-reflection amplitude coefficients. The wave-reflection amplitudes are affected by both defect depths and lengths. To estimate the defect depth, which is critical, length compensation was taken for defects shorter than the beam width. An axial scan was carried out for the defect length estimations and the length compensation. Based on this axial scan, an approximate two-dimensional theory has been developed that has improved the defect depth estimation greatly. Two-dimensional boundary element modeling analysis and normal mode expansion technology are used to study defect sizing theoretically in a pipe-like structure by calculating reflection coefficients. The theoretical results agree with the experiments quite favorably.},

  abstract = {This invention is a new inspection technique using ultra Sonic Lamb waves to measure reduction of pipe wall thick neSS due to localized corrosion at pipe Supports. The tech nique uses two transducers in a pitch-catch mode to Send and receive a Selected Lamb wave. The wave travels along the pipe wall in the circumferential direction. The reduction of the pipe wall thickness at the pipe Support changes the time-of-flight between the two transducers. By comparing time-of-flight data measured from the pipe Support area and from areas adjacent to the pipe Support, one can quantify the change of time-of-flight due to the pipe corrosion wall loss at the Support. A mathematical model, a sizing algorithm and a PC program have been developed to quantitatively relate in time-of-flight to the minimum remaining wall thickness. With them, one can quantify the minimum remaining pipe wall thickness at a pipe Support by Simply measuring the change in the time-of-flight.},

The experimental dispersion curves were obtained applying a 2D FFT algorithm to the data collected from an optical vibrometer. A Finite Element Model, using a commercial simulation program, PZFlex, was also developed to calculate the dispersion curves and to compare them with the analytical and experimental ones. Next, the Lamb wave modes were selectively reinforced or cancelled by bonding another piezoceramic to the plate at an appropriate location. Different models using PZFlex were developed to calculate the dispersion curves verifying the mode cancellations. The experimental measurements show good agreement with the models.},

However, the multimodal and dispersive nature of GW makes it difficult to analyze and interpret the signals. This has motivated the development at CEA LIST of a simulation tool dedicated to GW NDT implemented in the CIVA software. A general formulation has been derived from the reciprocity theorem, which allows simulating the complete GW NDT response in a modal decomposition. The simulation tool is divided in three modules and the guiding structures that can be addressed are plates and tubes, possibly multilayered. The first module allows modes computation, the second module computation of the field radiated by a transducer and the third module the full response of GW NDT control. Comparisons to literature and experimental data are provided and the developments in progress at CEA LIST in order to extend the capability of the GW NDT simulation tool are also presented.},

This is due to dispersion effects and multimode propagation. This paper describes an ultrasonic measurement method allowing us to inspect the corroded thickness of plates using Lamb waves. This method consists of measuring the group velocity of the S0 mode and then observing variations in velocity due to successive chemical attacks. From these data, it is possible to evaluate the progressively reduced thickness. Experimental and numerical results show that, depending on the chosen mode, the group velocity can be very sensitive to the reduction in thickness. Wavelet signal processing is suggested to extend this technique when several modes overlap.},

Isotropic and anisotropic materials with linear elastic and linear viscoelastic rheological behaviors can be considered, and any waveguide cross section can be modeled. For each existing wave, the dispersive results can be represented in terms of wave number, wavelength, phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped waveguides), energy velocity, and attenuation (for damped waveguides). By simply working with the GUI, original results for guided stress waves can be obtained. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000081. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {The motivation for this work is the development of load measurement techniques based on the velocity of propagating guided waves in structural members such as cable and rail. A finite element technique for modelling the dispersion characteristics of guided waves in a waveguide of arbitrary cross section subjected to axial load is presented. The results from the FE model are compared to results obtained from a simple Euler–Bernoulli beam model. A dimensionless measure of the sensitivity of phase and group velocity to load is defined as the fractional change in velocity divided by the applied strain. At frequency waveguide-characteristic-dimension products (fd) of greater than around 1 for phase velocity and 5 for group velocity the sensitivity to strain levels likely to be encountered in engineering materials is strain independent (indicating that the change in velocity is proportional to strain) and decreases with increasing frequency. In this fd range, phase velocity increases under tensile loading and group velocity decreases. For waveguides with simple cross sections, such as plates and circular rods, it is shown that the Euler–Bernoulli beam model provides acceptable results over the majority of the fd range where there is measurable sensitivity to load. However, for waveguides with more complex cross sections such as rail, the Euler–Bernoulli beam model is less satisfactory. In particular, it does not predict the subtleties of the sensitivity of certain modes at high frequencies, nor any sensitivity for the torsional fundamental mode.},

  abstract = {Two ultrasonic techniques are well established for pipe inspection and monitoring: highly sensitive ultrasonic spot thickness measurements, which can be presented in C-scan form, or low frequency guided waves that rapidly screen large areas for big defects. Recently there has been a growing interest in pipe inspection and monitoring systems exploring the middle ground between these two techniques by using higher frequency guided waves over shorter distances. In this paper the use of an axial transducer array (more suitable for monitoring applications) or a single axially scanned transducer (more suitable for inspections) that sends and receives dispersive circumferential guided waves around a pipe has been studied. The presence of a defect is detected as a result of a change in the wave travel time around the pipe circumference as a result of the thickness reduction. Both measurement modalities have a pitch between adjacent transducers/measurements. By approximating the pipe to a plate, a finite element model assisted method to evaluate the detection capabilities (probability of detection-POD) of this short range guided wave technique as a function of scan or transducer pitch is presented. The performance of three guided wave modes (A0, S0, and SH1) are compared in a 10mm thick plate. The results help to optimize the pitch and defect sensitivity of the setup. For the parameters investigated in this study, it was found that the S0 mode, at 2MHz.mm, is the most suitable for detecting wide shallow defects. For the same detection capabilities a much wider pitch can be used for S0 mode transducers as compared to SH1 mode transducers. Whereas the SH1 mode, at 3MHz.mm, is better suited to detecting narrow and deep defects using a relatively small pitch. The S0 mode is much less sensitive to these defects. The A0 mode was excluded from the POD analysis because it had a much higher variability in average thickness measurements, at comparable SNRs, compared to the other two modes.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ndteint.2017.07.004},
  abstract = {There is an increasing interest in high frequency short range guided waves to screen or monitor for corrosion. This contrasts with long range guided waves (LRGWs) which screen pipes for large patches of corrosion and have been successfully used in corrosion management for the past twenty years. The fundamental setup described in this paper uses circumferential guided waves, which are excited at a single location on a pipe and travel around the pipe wall and are detected at the same location. The study uses a finite element model assisted method to evaluate the detection capability of two short range circumferential guided wave setups which use both the reflected and transmitted signals. The setups themselves consist of either an axial array of transducers, for monitoring, or a single transducer which axially scans a pipe. Both setups have an array or scan pitch between either adjacent transducers or measurements. The detection capability of the fundamental Lamb wave modes (A0 and S0) in both reflection and transmission have been compared, as well as a hybrid shear horizontal wave setup, which uses the SH0 mode in reflection and the SH1 mode in transmission. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using two separate methods to determine the probability of detection (POD) for either the reflection or transmission signals. Both methods determine a POD for a specific defect, noise level, and array or scan pitch. Probability images are produced which map the POD for a range of defect sizes. For the parameters investigated in this study, it was found that in transmission large diameter defects have a higher detectability, whereas deep, narrow diameter defects are more detectable in reflection. A generalised overview of the sensitivity of short range guided waves is presented by combining both the reflection and transmission PODs. The data fused sensitivity of the S0 and SH hybrid modes are given as 0.6\% and 0.75\% cross sectional area (CSA) respectively, allowing for the comparison with LRGWs. The A0 mode was excluded from the POD analysis because it was much less sensitive than the other two modes.},

  abstract = {Adhesively bonded stiffeners are employed in aerospace applications to increase structural stiffness. The potential of feature-guided wave modes for the verification of adhesion and curing state in difficult-to-access regions has been investigated. The properties of guided wave modes propagating along a T-shaped stiffener bonded to an aluminium plate were calculated using the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method. Feature-guided modes dominated by shearing motion were identified to be well suited, with energy concentrated at the stiffener and bond line, limiting energy radiation into the plate and thus maximising inspection length. The influences of the bond line stiffness and thickness on the guided wave behaviour were investigated using SAFE and 3D Finite Element calculations, and found to be significant. Experiments were conducted to measure the properties of the guided waves during the curing of an epoxy joint attaching a stiffener to a plate. The feature-guided mode was excited using a piezo-electric shear transducer and measured using a laser interferometer. The measured phase speed changed significantly during curing. The frequency dependency was found to match well with the SAFE calculations for a variation of the shear (Coulomb) modulus of the adhesive. The potential of the feature-guided shear wave mode for bond line inspection and monitoring has been shown and the choice of guided wave mode and frequency range for good sensitivity to the bond line state discussed.},

  abstract = {This text is based on lectures given by the authors to students of the Physico Technical Institute in Moscow in the course of many years. Teaching mechan ics of continuous media to students in physics has some specific features. Un fortunately, the students rarely have enough time for this branch of science. Over a comparatively short period of time and without sophisticated mathe matics, the lecturer has to set forth the principal facts and methods of this rather important aspect of theoretical physics. The goal can be achieved only if the knowledge and intuition obtained by students in other courses has been mobilized efficiently. These observations have extensively been taken into account when classical as well as more contemporary and actively developing branches of mechanics of continua are considered. The theory of wave propagation is the most important topic in mechanics of continua for those who work in the field of physics and geophysics. That is why most attention is paid to this topic in the main text as well as in numerous exercises. The propagation of various kinds of hydrodynamic, magnetohydro dynamic, acoustic and seismic waves is considered in some detail. We begin with simple questions and proceed to more complicated ones. Accordingly, we treat the elasticity theory first. In the limits this appears to be simpler than the mechanics of fluids. For further study of each topic the reader will find references in the bibliography.},

  abstract = {The theory of waves in an infinitely long cylindrical rod was discussed by Pochhammer in 1876 in a well-known paper. The somewhat simpler problem of two-dimensional waves in a solid bounded by parallel planes was considered by Lord Rayleigh and by the present writer‡ in 1889. The main object in these various investigations was to verify, or to ascertain small corrections to, the ordinary theory of the vibrations of thin rods or plates, and the wave-length was accordingly assumed in the end to be great in comparison with the thickness. It occurred to me some time ago that a further examination of the two-dimensional problem was desirable for more than one reason. In the first place, the number of cases in which the various types of vibration of a solid, none of whose dimensions is regarded as small, have been studied is so restricted that any addition to it would have some degree of interest, if merely as a contribution to elastic theory. Again, modern seismology has suggested various questions relating to waves and vibrations in an elastic stratum imagined as resting on matter of a different elasticity and density. These questions naturally present great mathematical difficulties, and it seemed unpromising to attempt any further discussion of them unless the comparatively simple problem which forms the subject of this paper should be found to admit of a practical solution. In itself it has, of course, no bearing on the questions referred to.},

  abstract = {There are many advantages to adhesively bonding stiffeners onto aircraft structures rather than using traditional mechanical fastening methods. However there is a lack of confidence of the structural integrity of adhesively bonded joints over time. Acousto-ultrasonic Lamb waves have shown great potential in structural health monitoring applications in both metallic and composite structures. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the use of acousto-ultrasonic Lamb waves for the monitoring of adhesively bonded joints in metallic structures using 3D scanning laser vibrometry. Two stiffened panels were manufactured, one with an intentional disbonded region. Lamb wave interaction with the healthy and disbonded stiffeners was investigated at three excitation frequencies. A windowed root-mean-squared technique was applied to quantify where Lamb wave energy was reflected, attenuated and transmitted across the structure enabling the size and shape of the defect to be visualised which was verified by traditional ultrasonic inspection techniques.},

  abstract = {High-frequency devices operating at 3 GHz or higher are required, for instance, for future 4th generation mobile phone systems in Japan. Using a substrate with a high acoustic velocity is one method to realize a high-frequency acoustic or elastic device. A Lamb wave has a high velocity when the substrate thickness is thin. To realize a high-frequency device operating at 3 GHz or higher using a Lamb wave, a very thin (less than 0.5 μm thick) single-crystal plate must be used. It is difficult to fabricate such a very thin single crystal plate. The authors have attempted to use a c-axis orientated epitaxial LiNbO3thin film deposited by a chemical vapor deposition system (CVD) instead of using a thin LiNbO3single crystal plate. Lamb wave resonators composed of a interdigital transducer (IDT)/the LiNbO3film/air gap/base substrate structure like micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) transducers were fabricated. These resonators have shown a high frequency of 4.5 and 6.3 GHz, which correspond to very high acoustic velocities of 14 000 and 12 500 m/s, respectively, have excellent characteristics such as a ratio of resonant and antiresonant impedance of 52 and 38 dB and a wide band of 7.2\% and 3.7\%, respectively, and do not have spurious responses caused by the 0th modes of shear horizontal (SH0) and symmetric (S0) modes.},

  title = {Mode and {{Transducer Selection}} for {{Long Range Lamb Wave Inspection}}},
  abstract = {Lamb waves can propagate many metres along plate and shell structures, and so have great potential in ‘smart structure’ applications where it is important for a transducer to interrogate a significant area of the surrounding structure. However, there are many different types of Lamb wave and in order to obtain simple signals that can be reliably interpreted, it is important to excite a single mode in a well controlled direction. The choice of which Lamb wave mode to use in a particular application depends on numerous factors, including the resolution required, the type of defects or damage to be detected, the attenuation and the available transduction options. This paper sets out a rational procedure for identifying suitable Lamb wave modes and operating frequencies for a particular inspection task. It is shown that the properties of the system to be inspected determine which mode and frequencies can be used, and that this then dictates the type of transducer required. A procedure for evaluating the performance of Lamb wave transducers is also demonstrated. As an illustrative example, it is shown that the well known angle incidence transduction technique is not generally suitable in applications where the structure to be inspected is liquid loaded. In such cases it is necessary to consider alternative transduction options such as electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) or shear piezoelectric devices.},

  abstract = {Structural health monitoring is a prominent alternative to the scheduled maintenance of safety-critical components. The nondispersive nature as well as the through-thickness mode shape of the fundamental shear horizontal guided wave mode (SH0) make it a particularly attractive candidate for ultrasonic guided wave structural health monitoring. However, plane wave excitation of SH0 at a high level of purity remains challenging because of the existence of the fundamental Lamb modes (A0 and S0) below the cutoff frequency thickness product of high-order modes. This paper presents a piezoelectric transducer concept optimized for plane SH0 wave transduction based on the transducer geometry. The transducer parameter exploration was initially performed using a simple analytical model. A 3D multiphysics ﬁnite element model was then used to reﬁne the transducer design. Finally, an experimental validation was conducted with a 3D laser Doppler vibrometer system. The analytical model, the ﬁnite element model, and the experimental measurement showed excellent agreement. The modal selectivity of SH0 within a 20◦ beam opening angle at the design frequency of 425 kHz in a 1.59 mm aluminum plate was 23 dB, and the angle of the 6 dB wavefront was 86◦.},

Such fundamental data as phase velocity, group velocity, and wave structure for each guided wave mode is presented for structures with complicated cross-sectional geometries as rail. Phase velocity and group velocity dispersion curves are obtained for bars with an arbitrary cross-section using a semi-analytical finite element method. Since a large number of propagating modes with close phase velocities exist, dispersion curves consisting of only dominant modes are obtained by calculating the displacement at a received point for each mode.

  abstract = {Lamb wave propagation in plates is multi-modal, dispersive and highly dependent on the material properties. In homogeneous isotropic plates, Lamb modes can be grouped into symmetric and anti-symmetric modes, and they are decoupled from the shear modes. Due to the material isotropy, Lamb wave propagation behavior is independent from the propagation direction. This property can be used to find analytical solutions for the field of displacements in the frequency domain. However, in composite plates having anisotropic material properties, Lamb wave propagation behavior depends on the propagation direction. For this reason, the complexity of Lamb wave propagation modes increases, and no direct analytical solutions are available. Thus, numerical methods need to be used. In this paper, the semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method is applied as it is suitable for both isotropic homogeneous plates and anisotropic composite laminated plates. Dispersion curves for these complex materials are calculated using SAFE. The effect of obstacles on the reflection and transmission of Lamb waves is considered. SAFE is also used for 2D point force response analysis. By applying the 2D point response analysis for perfectly bonded strip actuators, mode tuning behavior is calculated for general composite plates. A method to consider plate edge reflections in the 2D force response analysis is also presented.},

This study describes leaky Lamb wave calculation with the SAFE. We formulated a new solution using a feature that a single Lamb wave mode generates a harmonic plane wave in leaky media. Dispersion curves obtained with the SAFE agreed well with the previous theoretical studies, which represents that the SAFE calculation was conducted with sufficient accuracy. Moreover, we discussed dispersion curves, attenuation curves, and displacement distributions for total transmission modes and leaky plate modes in a single side and both two side water-loaded plate.},

  abstract = {The application of guided waves in NOT can be hampered by the Iack of readily available dispersion curves for complex structures. To overcome this hindrance, we have developed a general purpose program that can create dispersion curves for a very wide range of systems and then effectively communicate the information contained within those curves. The program uses the global matrix method to handle multi-layered Cartesian and cylindrical systems. The solution routines cover both leaky and non-leaky cases and remain robust for systems which are known to be difficult, such as!arge frequency-thicknesses and thin layers embedded in much thicker layers. Elastic and visco-elastic isotropic materials are fully supported; anisotropic materials are also covered, but are currently limited to the elastic, non-leaky, Cartesian case. An extremely!arge amount of work has already been clone to describe the wave propagation in layered systems, which began in the late nineteenth century and continues today There is not enough space in this paper to describe the contributions that many excellent researchers have made to the field. Instead, this paper describes how we have combined some of this previous work and our own research to create a robust, user friendly, general purpose tool.

  abstract = {There are many scenarios in industrial ultrasound where the signals lie below the noise threshold, i.e. SNR {$<$}; 0 dB. Examples include electromagnetic-acoustic transducers (EMATs). EMATs are contactless and can penetrate through non-conductive coating layers requiring minimum surface preparation. However, they are also inefficient and hence power inputs in the order of a few kW are needed. They would be ideal for wall thickness monitoring in oil and gas installations but intrinsic safety regulations require low power inputs so they have been disregarded to date. A potential solution is to use averaging over many repetitions but this takes a long time, and any changes, such as temperature drifts, ultimately limit their performance. An alternative is to use coded sequences, they require less acquisition time but in the past their length has been limited by the time it takes the wave to travel to the closest reflector and back. The presented approach removes this limitation by introducing receive intervals into long coded sequences, so that reception can take place intermittently and on average signals from nearby reflectors are not masked. The optimal synthesis of these sequences is discussed; sequences that have the same number of receive and transmit intervals of equal length are found to perform optimally and are an order of magnitude faster than averaging when SNR {$<$}; 0 dB. As a result, EMATs can be driven with 4.5 Vpp (less than 0.4 W) obtaining a clear signal in quasi-real-time (e.g. 9 Hz refresh rate) using the proposed sequences.},

  title = {Advanced Ultrasonic Techniques for Nondestructive Testing of Austenitic and Dissimilar Welds in Nuclear Facilities},
  doi = {10.1063/1.5031581},
  abstract = {Austenitic stainless steel welds as well as dissimilar metal welds with nickel alloy filler material, used in safety relevant parts of nuclear power plants, still challenge the ultrasonic inspection. The weld material forms large oriented grains that lead, on the one hand, to high sound scattering and, on the other hand, to inhomogeneity and to the acoustic anisotropy of the weld structure. The ultrasonic wave fronts do not propagate linearly, as in ferritic weld joints, but along the curves, which depend on the specific grain structure of the weld. Due to the influence of these phenomena, it is difficult to analyze the inspection results and to classify the ultrasonic indications, which could be both from the weld geometry and from the material defects. A correct flaw sizing is not possible. In an ongoing research project, different techniques to improve the reliability of ultrasonic testing at these kinds of welds are investigated. In a first step (in the previous research project) two ultrasonic inspection techniques were developed and validated on plane test specimens with artificial and realistic flaws. In the ongoing project, these techniques are applied to circumferential pipe welds with longitudinal and transverse flaws. The technique developed at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) in Germany uses a combination of ray tracing and synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT). To investigate the unknown grain structure, the velocity distribution of weld-transmitting ultrasound waves is measured and used to model the weld by ray tracing. The second technique, developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Nondestructive Testing (IZFP) in Germany, uses Sampling Phased Array (Full Matrix Capture) combined with the reverse phase matching (RPM) and the gradient elastic constant descent algorithm (GECDM). This inspection method is able to estimate the elastic constants of the columnar grains in the weld and offers an improvement of the reliability of ultrasonic testing through the correction of the sound field distortion. The unknown inhomogeneity and anisotropy are investigated using a reference indication and the special optimization algorithm. Both reconstruction techniques give quantitative inspection results and allow the defect sizing. They have been compared to conventional ultrasonic testing with techniques that are state of the art for components in nuclear power plants. The improvement will be quantified by the comparison of the probability of detection (POD) of each technique.},

This limits the resolution that can be obtained in a long-range guided wave inspection system. A technique is presented for quickly predicting the rate of spreading of a dispersive wave-packet as it propagates. It is shown that the duration of a wave-packet increases linearly with propagation distance. It is also shown that the duration of a wave-packet after a given propagation distance can be minimised by optimising the input signal. A dimensionless parameter called minimum resolvable distance (MRD) is defined that enables a direct comparison to be made between the resolution attainable at different operating points. Some conclusions are made concerning the resolution of various operating points for the case of Lamb waves in an aluminium plate.},

Experimental results are then presented which show good quantitative agreement with the modelled results. An advanced processing algorithm is also implemented which allows the array to be focused at every point in the target region in both transmission and reception. This approach is shown to offer signiﬁcant performance advantages for NDE.},

These two men developed the first prototype system for ultrasound, but it wasn’t perfected until the end of the 1950s. The history of the ultrasound dates back even further than the 1950s, however.

SPC involves the removal of minority elements while leaving behind a copper matrix. Pulsed eddy current (PEC) was evaluated for determination of SPC thickness on a NAB valve section with access from the surface corroded side. A primarily linear response of PEC amplitude, up to the maximum available SPC thickness of 4 mm was observed. The combination of reduced conductivity and permeability in the SPC phase relative to the base NAB was used to explain the observed sensitivity of PEC to SPC thickness variations.},

  abstract = {Pulsed eddy current testing (PECT) is a powerful candidate for the detection of wall thinning of insulated ferromagnetic pipes in petrochemical and power generation plants. The main purpose of this study is to ﬁnd an efﬁcient and easy-to-use signal feature for the assessment of wall thinning. Analytical modeling for a PECT probe over the insulated piping system is performed and its result is veriﬁed by experimental test. Two time-related features, the peak value and the time-to-peak, are found in the differential signal obtained by subtracting the test signal from the reference signal. The time-to-peak is superior to the peak value due to its linear variation with wall thickness. Inﬂuences of various conditions in practical testing on the PECT signal are investigated. Results show that the time-to-peak is independent of the insulation thickness and the probe lift-off. Robustness of time-topeak to probe conﬁguration is also validated by employing three probes of different dimensions and structures. To determine the linear range of time-to-peak with amount of wall thinning, differential signals based on different reference thicknesses are examined. Results show that the time-to-peak only keeps linear for the relative wall thinning less than 60\%, but still can be effectively used for calibration purpose in periodical in-service inspection of insulated pipeline.},

The spatial wavelength of an imposed omega-k magnetometer with a periodic winding construct can be used to vary the depth of penetration into magnetic and conducting media, without adjusting the input current frequency.

The equivalent circuit impedance formulae lor an infinitely long solenoid with a conductive tube inside are derived. This simplified theoretical model is applied to calculate the tube wall thickness using the measured resistance and inductance of a real long coil with a long tube inside. In order to take into account the coil’s finite length, an apparent fill factor is introduced. The last parameter is determined experimentally and used as the fill factor in the theoretical model. We report experimental tests for brass and copper tubes of nominal dliameters in the range 12-20mm and nominal thickness from 0.9 to 2.5mm. An uncertainty of the wall thickness measurements typically within 2\% is obtained. ‘Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Thanks to its richness of spectral components, various applications of this technique have been proposed and reported in the literature covering both structural integrity inspection and material characterization in various industrial sectors. To support its development and for better understanding of the phenomena around the transient induced eddy currents, attempts for its modelling both analytically and numerically have been made by researchers around the world. This review is an attempt to capture the state-of-the-art development and applications of PEC, especially in the last 15 years and it is not intended to be exhaustive. Future challenges and opportunities for PEC NDT\&E are also presented.},

  abstract = {Pulsed eddy current (PEC) is an advanced non-destructive testing (NDT) technique that operates based on electromagnetic principle and widely used in various industry including aviation, petrochemical and transportation. Compared to conventional eddy current technique, the major advantages of this technique is it contains a wideband of frequency in its excitation which makes it highly sensitive in distinguishing the location of defects deeply buried in conductive materials. The PEC system is established through a combination of several equipment i.e. power supply, oscilloscope, amplifier, pre amplifier and multifunction generator. For the highest sensitivity in detection, the probe that acts as the detector is designed and fabricated with a magnetic sensor at its core. Generally, during the PEC experiment, the probe is place on the surface of the specimen and the signals obtain are simultaneously transferred and displayed on the oscilloscope. Among the basic testing that can be performed by PEC system include conductivity measurement for material sorting and thickness measurement. For the validation purposes, the results obtained through the experiment are compared with the results from finite element method (FEM) simulation conducted using COMSOL software.},

This paper examines three different probe orientations that could be used for their influence on the pulsed eddy current method to localize information on pipe wall thickness. All three orientations will have difficulty measuring highly localized thinning because the eddy currents that give rise to their signal spread out rapidly in the region commonly used for measuring thickness, i.e. the long time decay. Of the three orientations, the longitudinal one does the best job of localizing the eddy currents directly under the probe.},

  abstract = {Remote Field Eddy Current Testing (RFECT) has broad applications in ferromagnetic pipe testing due to the same testing sensitivity to inner and outer wall defects. However, how to quantify wall thickness in the RFECT of pipes is still a big problem. According to researchers' studies, a linear relationship exists between the wall thickness, permeability and conductivity of a pipe and the phase of the RFECT signal. Aiming to quantify wall thickness by using this linear function, it is necessary to further study the effects of pipe permeability and conductivity on the phase of the RFECT signal. When the product value of the permeability and the conductivity of a pipe remains constant, the univariate analysis and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are employed to analyze the variations among the phase of the RFECT signal caused by different couples of permeability and conductivity. These variations are calibrated by using a nonlinear fitting method. Moreover, Multi-Frequency Eddy Current Testing (MFECT) is applied to inverse the permeability and conductivity of a pipe to compensate for the quantification analysis of wall thickness. The methods proposed in this paper are validated by analyzing the simulation signals and can improve the practicality of RFECT of ferromagnetic pipes.},

However, most commercial PEC service providers as well as researchers have investigated and claim functionality of sensors on homogeneous structural steels (steel grade Q235 for example). In this paper, we present design steps for a PEC sensing set-up to measure thickness of cast iron, which is unlike steel, is a highly inhomogeneous and non-linear ferromagnetic material. The setup includes a PEC sensor, sensor excitation and reception circuits, and a unique signal processing method. The signal processing method yields a signal feature which behaves as a function of thickness. The signal feature has a desirable characteristic of being lowly inﬂuenced by lift-off. Experimental results show that the set-up is usable for Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) applications such as cast iron water pipe assessment.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic-acoustic transducers (EMATs) consist of a magnet and a coil. They are advantageous in some non-destructive evaluation (NDE) applications because no direct contact with the specimen is needed to send and receive ultrasonic waves. However, EMATs commonly require excitation peak powers greater than 1 kW and therefore the driving electronics and the EMAT coils have to be bulky. This has hindered the development of EMAT phased arrays with characteristics similar to those of conventional piezoelectric phased arrays. Phased arrays are widely used in NDE because they offer superior defect characterization in comparison to single-element transducers. In this paper, we report a series of novel techniques and design elements that make it possible to construct an EMAT phased array that performs similarly to conventional piezoelectric arrays used in NDE. One of the key enabling features is the use of coded excitation to reduce the excitation peak power to less than 4.8 W (24 Vpp and 200 mA) so that racetrack coils with dimensions 3:2 Â 18 mm2 can be employed. Moreover, these racetrack coils are laid out along their shortest dimension so that 1/3 of their area is overlapped. This helps to reduce the crosstalk between the coils, i.e., the array elements, to less than À15 dB. We show that an 8-element EMAT phased array operating at a central frequency of 1 MHz can be used to detect defects which have a width and a depth of 0.2 and 0.8 mm respectively and are located on the surface opposite to the array.},
